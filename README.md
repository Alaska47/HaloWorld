This application, HaloWorld, is designed to use crowd sourcing in order to save lives by speeding up response time for basic medical issues such as cardiac arrest.

Upon launch, a user will be sent to a registration screen where they will create an account based on their phone number and name. Following that, they will follow a registration process in order to identify their region, their status (either Plebian or Angel), and what medical treatment they are capable of performing, such as usage of AED or CPR.

Following this, and on all subsequent launches, the user will be sent to the main screen where a panic button can be clicked in order to report an event. Following this, three basic questions will be asked in order to identify the type of injury and who could best assist the hurt person. Then, an alert will be sent to nearby docotrs who can come assist.
